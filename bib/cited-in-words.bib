The principal materials used are data on the proportions single in each age group at various times. These data are used to estimate how far the `marriage boom' has reflected decreases in the proportions of persons remaining single throughout life or reductions in the age at marriage of those who do marry. The conclusion is that changes of both types have occurred; the mean age at marriage has been declining in several countries at a rate of more than one-tenth of a year per annum. A number of ancillary technical problems relating to the analysis of nuptiality are discussed.},

By addressing this question, this article extends previous work in which the authors show that population aging leads to an increased demand for wealth that can, under some conditions, lead to increased capital per worker and higher per capita consumption. This article is based on an overlapping generations (OLG) model which highlights the quantity--quality tradeoff and the links between human capital investment and economic growth. It incorporates new national level estimates of human capital investment produced by the National Transfer Accounts project. Simulation analysis is employed to show that, even in the absence of the capital dilution effect, low fertility leads to higher per capita consumption through human capital accumulation, given plausible model parameters.},

  abstract = {The further opening up of demography to related social science disciplines is a felicitous outcome, provided that this does not lead to a segregated set of mono-paradigmatic approaches or explanations. Hence, we need to go beyond the anchored narrative approach. In the philosophy of science, several paths for such further theory integration are available, and the present essay makes use of two such approaches: Imre Lakatos's program of "progressive problem shifts" and L. Jonathan Cohen's "inductive knowledge of comparative reliability." An application is made to three theories of the so-called second demographic transition, by showing that (1) these theories are by no means mutually exclusive, (2) their mechanisms are often interrelated and synergistic, and (3) the plausibility of a theory may depend on a chosen subgroup or context in time or space. Given these properties, such partial theories or separate narratives are prime candidates for inclusion into a more overarching multiparadigmatic and multi-causal Theory.}

  abstract = {This article analyses the transformation in the mode of partnership formation in seven countries of Eastern Europe. The aim of the study is to provide an up-to-date account of the switch from direct marriage to non-marital cohabitation as it has progressed from the 1960s to the mid-2000s, using data from the Generations and Gender Surveys. Unlike previous analyses of partnership formation, we examined the extent to which crossnational variations, in the onset and scale of transformation characteristic of the Second Demographic Transition (SDT), could be linked to nuptiality regimes that existed in the region in the 19th and early 20th centuries. With few exceptions, the results support the notion of correspondence between historical and contemporary patterns. Forerunners in the transition to partnership formation outside marriage tend to come from areas which exhibited a late/low prevalence of marriage; the latecomers are typically situated east of the Hajnal line. Thus our study corroborates earlier findings pertaining to the legacy the historical marriage patterns, extending them further, from the onset of the first to the second demographic transition. Our results are also in line with idea of the spatial continuity across successive waves of demographic innovation demonstrated in several studies for Western Europe. The findings reported in the article make a similar argument for Eastern Europe. In a broader framework, the results point to diversity of pathways along which family and fertility characteristic of the SDT have evolved. In view of the evidence presented in the article, Eastern Europe seems to embody two variants with regard to synchronism between a shift from direct marriage to non-marital cohabitation and postponement of childbearing.}

The outcomes of cohabitation are also considered-both the dissolution of unions and the transformation of cohabiting unions into marriage. These data indicate that large proportions of men and women experience cohabitation fairly early in the life course. At the same time, many cohabiting unions are dissolved fairly quickly and numerous others are soon transformed into marriages. Thus even though cohabitation will be experienced by many, most people will continue to spend substantially more time in marital unions than in cohabiting unions.},
